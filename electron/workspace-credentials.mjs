// stay testable without an Electron runtime.

// One row per secret: the config.json home it migrates OUT of, the
// credentials.bin field it lives in, and the env var the spawned server
// prefers over the file (server/config.ts loadConfig).

/** One boot-time sweep of config.json: move every plaintext workspace secret
 * into the encrypted store and DELETE the plaintext field.
 *
 * Deleting (never blanking) keeps "" meaningful. The server persists a
 * credential save by writing the field — a mid-session save lands as the new
 * value, a mid-session clear lands as "". So on the next boot:
 *   - non-empty value  → newest user intent: overwrite the stored secret
 *   - ""               → the user cleared it: drop the stored secret too
 *   - field absent     → already migrated: keep what the store holds
 * Running twice is a no-op, and nothing is lost if a boot dies between the
 * two writes — the caller persists credentials BEFORE rewriting config, so
 * the worst case re-runs the same overwrite.
 *
 * Inputs are treated as immutable; the changed flags tell the caller which
 * file(s) actually need rewriting. Non-string junk in a field is left for
 * the server's schema to reject rather than silently destroyed here. */
